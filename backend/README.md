# Node.js Backend Project

This is the backend of your Node.js project, built with [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) and other modern tools to streamline development and database management.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or higher recommended)
- npm (v6 or higher recommended)
- A supported database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite)

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project locally.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Copy the environment configuration file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Update the `.env` file with your environment-specific variables (e.g., database credentials).

### Database Setup

1. Run migrations to set up the database schema:

   ```bash
   npm run sequelize db:migrate
   ```

2. Seed the database with initial data:

   ```bash
   npm run sequelize db:seed:all
   ```

### Running the Project

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will start and be accessible at `http://localhost:4000` (or the port specified in your `.env` file).

## Available Scripts

Here are the available npm scripts for development and management:

- **`npm install`**: Installs all dependencies.
- **`npm run sequelize db:migrate`**: Applies database migrations.
- **`npm run sequelize db:seed:all`**: Seeds the database with initial data.
- **`npm run dev`**: Starts the development server.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, ensure:

1. The `.env` file is properly configured with your database credentials.
2. The database server is running and accessible.
3. Dependencies are installed (`npm install`).
